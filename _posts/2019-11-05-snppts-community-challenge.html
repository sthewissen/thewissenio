<p>As you probably know I'm one of the co-founders of <a href="https://www.thewissen.io/out-now-snppts-for-xamarin-forms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="the Snppts platform (opens in a new tab)">the Snppts platform</a> together with my bestie Gerald Versluis. This month of November is all about getting more content into the platform and what better way to do it than with a Community Challenge!</p>

<h3>What is Snppts again?</h3>
<p>Snppts&nbsp;is an <a href="https://snppts.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="aggregator (opens in a new tab)">aggregator</a> for beautiful Xamarin.Forms UI snippets for and from the community. Never checked it out? Now is the time to find some truly inspiring designs for your apps!</p>


<p>We have teamed up with the lovely people over at Microsoft to bring you our first community challenge! For this challenge, we challenge you to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://snppts.dev/how-to-contribute" target="_blank">contribute</a>&nbsp;your own UI snippet to Snppts. You can also give back and make a PR to the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/snpptsdev/snppts" target="_blank">core platform</a>. Any valid PR will be rewarded with a one-of-a-kind, and completely brand-new, Snppts sticker!</p>
