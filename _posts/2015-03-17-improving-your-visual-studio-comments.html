<p>In my adventures in the Xamarin mobile world I particularly liked the fact how their Xamarin Studio IDE visually handles TODO comments. Basically, all it does is make the TODO part bold. I know that it's a small thing to worry about, but I value the comments in my code and am a sucker for creating some more clarity within them. <!--more-->In my search for a similar (or better) experience in Visual Studio I came across the <strong>CommentsPlus </strong>extension. Could this be the one?</p>
<p>Let me start off by saying that I believe Resharper also has some similar functions but with that being a considerable investment, I was looking for a free alternative. CommentsPlus offers just that. A simple, configurable plugin that lets you create all sorts of different comment types. What kind of comments you ask? Well, out of the box it supports the following markup:</p>
<p><img src="/images/posts/screen.png" alt="screen" width="389" height="145" class="img-responsive alignnone size-full wp-image-85" /></p>
<p>If you can't appreciate all the happy colors in your IDE, CommentsPlus is willing to let you customize them by going into your <em>Options</em> dialog under <em>Environment > Fonts and Colors > Text Editor</em>. It's also still being actively developed and will at some point even include tags like <code>//+</code>, <code>//++</code>, <code>//-</code> and <code>//--</code> to create bigger and smaller fonts. All in all it definetly gives my comments a bit more context than can be done with text alone and that's a good thing.</p>
