<p>They say that seeing new places can work wonders for your creativity. I've recently gone on a trip to Seattle, visiting the Microsoft MVP Summit. With half an hour to kill in between sessions, I started tinkering with another UI sample in Xamarin Forms. This is the result of that.</p>

<p>By now you must know how these posts go, so I won't be going into a lot of the details. I find a cool looking UI and replicate it in Xamarin.Forms. Everything is open source on Github and I will be picking out some things that are special about this and highlighting how they're done. Sounds easy enough right?</p>

<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter"><img src="/images/posts/travel_app_dribbble_2x.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1283"/></figure>
</div>

<p>The inspiration for this post came from the above shot found on <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/6079769-Travel-App-Exploration">Dribbble</a>, which was made by <a href="https://dribbble.com/panjipam">Panji Pamungkas</a>. Not all that you see is part of this little sample, such as the custom tab bar and even though that would be a very fun avenue to explore it's also a very complicated one. I still want to have fun while doing this. Implementing that would start to look like this was work ;)</p>

<h3>The rounded corners</h3>
<p>One of the first things that stands out is the use of rounded corners. The header picture has a nice rounded corner on the bottom right with a content panel on top of that, which also has two rounded corners on opposite sides.</p>


<p>This is where my recently <g class="gr_ gr_9 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace" id="9" data-gr-id="9">developed </g><code>PancakeView</code><g class="gr_ gr_9 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Style multiReplace" id="9" data-gr-id="9"> comes</g> in handy. It's essentially a layout element (based on <code>ContentView</code>) that comes with built-in support for background gradients, rounded corners, borders <g class="gr_ gr_6 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="6" data-gr-id="6">and</g> shadows. It's <g class="gr_ gr_15 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-del replaceWithoutSep" id="15" data-gr-id="15">a perfect</g> fit for this part!</p>

*Our end result on Android, with a minor quirk :(<br>*

<p>Unfortunately, this is where we run into a small issue. As you can see the bottom right corner isn't rounded off correctly on Android. This is due to a limitation on Android where, if you want to clip the content inside of a view (the image), all of your corners need to be rounded using the same radius. However, this is not an issue for the white overlay panel because it has no content inside of it that overlays the corners. On <g class="gr_ gr_7 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="7" data-gr-id="7">iOS</g> this is also not an issue.</p>

<p>An alternative option for this is using FFImageLoading Transformations. This is a library on top of FFImageLoading that lets you render images using individual rounded corners. The code for this can be found in <a href="https://gist.github.com/sthewissen/07e8a50c04e7ac2989abf4195f59b2f0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="this Gist (opens in a new tab)">this Gist</a>.</p>

<h3>The new CollectionView</h3>
<p>This app has two horizontally scrolling sections with content, one for the "Hot places" and one for "Categories". This can easily be done by using a <code>ScrollView</code> and <g class="gr_ gr_10 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace" id="10" data-gr-id="10">a </g><code>BindableLayout</code><g class="gr_ gr_10 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Style multiReplace" id="10" data-gr-id="10">.</g> However, if you're willing to venture into the preview bits you will find <g class="gr_ gr_11 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace" id="11" data-gr-id="11"><g class="gr_ gr_5 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del" id="5" data-gr-id="5">the</g> </g><code>CollectionView</code><g class="gr_ gr_11 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Style multiReplace" id="11" data-gr-id="11">,</g> which is also equally capable of pulling off this kind of layout.</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/sthewissen/fef58c5c6f77944b5ddc6424ecffe7e6.js"></script>
<p>You might be wondering how to use these preview bits. Simply update your Xamarin<g class="gr_ gr_8 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style replaceWithoutSep" id="8" data-gr-id="8">.Forms</g> NuGet <g class="gr_ gr_7 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="7" data-gr-id="7">package</g> to the latest 4.0 preview version and add the line shown above to <g class="gr_ gr_9 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace" id="9" data-gr-id="9">your </g><code>AppDelegate.cs</code><g class="gr_ gr_9 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Style multiReplace" id="9" data-gr-id="9"> and</g> <code>MainActivity</code> (before <g class="gr_ gr_10 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace" id="10" data-gr-id="10">the </g><code>Forms.Init()</code><g class="gr_ gr_10 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Style multiReplace" id="10" data-gr-id="10"> call</g>. After <g class="gr_ gr_47 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="47" data-gr-id="47">that</g> you're good to go!</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/sthewissen/5e9da5af2d7778737231d399d3bbfd5e.js"></script>
<p>Keep in mind though, these are preview bits, so there may be things in there that don't entirely work as they should. Don't go shipping this in a production app just yet ;)</p>

<h3>Creating a dark semi-transparent overlay</h3>
<p>You may not even notice this subtle effect on the "Hot Places" images, but there's an overlay of a black fade from the bottom to the top on each of them. It adds a bit of character and uniformity to the images while also providing a good backdrop for the text to become more legible. So how's that done?</p>

<p><!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":1300,"width":237,"height":512,"linkDestination":"media"} --></p>
<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><a href="/images/posts/ios.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="/images/posts/ios-473x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1300" width="237" height="512"/></a>
*The end result on iOS, fancy pants!*

<p>Here's where good <g class="gr_ gr_6 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling" id="6" data-gr-id="6">ol</g>' <code>PancakeView</code> comes back in again. As mentioned before it also has a gradient background feature, which we can leverage to achieve this effect. To get this to work we need to cleverly stack <g class="gr_ gr_5 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del" id="5" data-gr-id="5">two </g><code>PancakeView</code><g class="gr_ gr_5 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del" id="5" data-gr-id="5">s</g> on top of one another. One contains the actual image and creates rounded corners. The other one is overlayed on top of that and creates a gradient background going from black to transparent.</p>

<p><!-- wp:image {"align":"center","id":1301,"width":483,"height":319} --></p>
<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="/images/posts/layercomp.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-1301" width="483" height="319"/>
*The composition of layers creating the overlay effect*

<p>The shot above shows how these two <code>PancakeView</code>s are layered on top of one another to create the effect. It's a really simple solution but it adds to the overall experience. The code for it is this little snippet right here:</p>

<h3>Let's have a chat about icon fonts</h3>
<p>If you're not using an icon font yet to render out all of your icons you really should consider it. There are numerous of these fonts out there such as <a href="https://fontawesome.com/icons">FontAwesome</a> that you can freely use which offer you a wide range of icons.  I use FontAwesome to create the notification bell icon, the rating stars <g class="gr_ gr_162 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="162" data-gr-id="162">and</g> category icons in this UI sample.</p>


<p>But why use a font instead of images? Fonts are vector-based which allows you to infinitely scale them without any loss of quality. It also allows you to use all 16 million colors available to you to tint your icon, whereas using images you'd have to create separate images for all of these occasions.</p>


<p>Using custom fonts is always a pain in the ass, so I recently reached out to Matthew Robbins of <a href="https://www.mfractor.com/">MFractor</a> fame to see if we could improve that. Within weeks he came up with this brilliant solution: a Font Importer! This is now part of MFractor and greatly simplifies the workflow around using custom fonts, so you should really give it a try!</p>
