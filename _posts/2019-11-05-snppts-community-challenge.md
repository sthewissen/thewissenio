As you probably know I'm one of the co-founders of [the Snppts platform](https://www.thewissen.io/out-now-snppts-for-xamarin-forms/) together with my bestie Gerald Versluis. This month of November is all about getting more content into the platform and what better way to do it than with a Community Challenge!




 







### What is Snppts again?




Snppts is an [aggregator](https://snppts.dev/) for beautiful Xamarin.Forms UI snippets for and from the community. Never checked it out? Now is the time to find some truly inspiring designs for your apps!





We have teamed up with the lovely people over at Microsoft to bring you our first community challenge! For this challenge, we challenge you to [contribute](https://snppts.dev/how-to-contribute) your own UI snippet to Snppts. You can also give back and make a PR to the [core platform](https://github.com/snpptsdev/snppts). Any valid PR will be rewarded with a one-of-a-kind, and completely brand-new, Snppts sticker!
