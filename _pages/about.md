I‚Äôm a freelance .NET developer from the Netherlands with a focus on mobile and web development. Started working with Xamarin in 2014 and have been in love with it ever since. I also enjoy spending time on OSS projects, writing blogs, podcasting and live-streaming. 

Sharing with the community and helping people with the content I create is what motivates me on a daily basis. I also have a passion for design that I like to express in all of my work. I‚Äôm always eager to learn new things and consider myself to have a growth mindset.

When I‚Äôm not coding you can find me on Twitter, playing soccer, cycling, or just having some fun and the occasional drink with my friends. If you bring cookies, chocolate, and/or a nice beer we can quickly become best friends! üç´üç∫
